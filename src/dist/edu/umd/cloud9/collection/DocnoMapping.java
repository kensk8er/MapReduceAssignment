/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for an object that maintains the mapping between docids and docnos.
 * A docid is a globally-unique String identifier for a document in the
 * collection. For many types of information retrieval algorithms, documents in
 * the collection must be sequentially numbered; thus, each document in the
 * collection must be assigned a unique integer identifier, which is its docno.
 * Typically, the docid to docno mappings are stored in a mappings file, which
 * is loaded into memory by concrete objects implementing this interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unless there are compelling reasons otherwise, it is preferable to start
 * numbering docnos from one instead of zero. This is because zero cannot be
 * represented in many common compression schemes that are used in information
 * retrieval (e.g., Golomb codes).
